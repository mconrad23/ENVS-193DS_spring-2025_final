    "text": "a. Transparent statistical methods\nIn part 1 my co-worker used a correlation test to assess the linear relationship between the distance from the headwater (km) and the annual nitrogen load (kg year⁻¹). In their statement they use the term “correlation” and provide a p-value. In part 2 they used an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the mean nitrogen load across more than one course category (urban land, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, wastewater treatment, and grasslands). ANOVA is usually sued to test for differences in means cross more than two groups, so we can infer that this is what they likely used."

Only including a p-value tells us that the difference likely exists but not how large or significant that difference is. By including an effect size would help to assign a quantity for how much of the variation in nitrogen load can be explained by the type of source its coming fro, which is critical for making informed management decisions. Another test that could be done is Tukey’s HSD or post-doc pairwise comparison as the results from the ANOVA only tell that some group means differ but doesn’t say which ones are different from each other. Doing a post-hoc test would identify whether, for example, nitrogen load from waste water treatment differed significantly than that from fertilizer."

This relationship is supported by a correlation analysis (Pearson’s correlation test: r = correlation coefficient, p = 0.03, α = significance level).\nSuggested rewrite for part 2:\nThe average nitrogen load was different among land use and nitrogen source categories, which suggests that certain types of sources contribute more to nitrogen input in the San Joaquin River Delta. This was supported by an analysis of variance (F-statistic = [F-value], degrees of freedom = [df1, df2], p = 0.02, α = [significance level]). Howwver, the inclusion of post-hoc comparisons and effect size measures are needed to identify which sources differ and the magnitude of their contributions."

Interpret your results\nThe figure made in part h (Figure 5) shows the model predictions of the probability of nest box occupancy by the Swift Parrot as a function of distance from the forest edge, with separate lines for each season (2016 and 2019). The predicted probabilities calculated at specific distances (0 to 900 m) made in part j reveal that occupancy is higher at the forest edge and as distance from the forest edge increased to 900 m, the probability of occupancy decreased rapidly; this indicates a significant negative relationship between distance and the probability of occupancy. This trend likely reflects the species’ preference or dependence on forest edge habitats for food availability and protection from predation and differences between the two seasons analyzed may reflect annual variations in species population or environmental conditions that affect the suitability of the habitat. This trend is also in opposition to a comperting species examined in the study, the Tree Martin, who’s occupancy of nest boxes increases with their distance from the forest edge in both 2016 and 2019."

Comparing visualizations\nThe exploratory visualization I made for Homework 2 is much more traditional in the sense that it is a box-plot that shows the correlation between productivity level and the type of music listened to for a handful of study session data entries. The affective visualization made for Homework 3 tells a more complete story about how each type of music affected my studying through the use of color, notes about my emotions and mental state, and differing sizes of brain waves\nBetween the visualizations I would say there are similarities in that greater productivity is associated more closely with listening to classical or ambient music. Both also show that I am less focused and productive when listening to elctropop and folk music\nHomework 2 contains less data entries to work off of than Homework 3 but overall the trend stayed the same; greater productivity and focus is associated with classical and ambient music and more distraction is associated with electropop and folk music. I would say that it is hard to make definitive conclusions, as there are more instances where I am listening to either classical or ambient music while studying than when I choose to listen to electropop or folk music, meaning that the sample size for these music types is greater and more predictable.\nI got some feedback about how to orient the visualization as I was having trouble figuring out how to do a horizontal color gradient and a peer recommended I try orienting it diagonally across my paper which worked better. Also, this wasn’t a recommendation from a classmate or instrcutor, but I decided to pivot my visualization a bit from my initail sketch to use brain waves as the representation of the focus level, which I feel worked better to convey how I was feeling in each study session based on the music type"
